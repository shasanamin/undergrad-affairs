# Select Undergraduate Work

This repository contains some interesting, atypical work (so 'sadly' no sorting algorithm implementations here) during my undergraduate years, done mostly but not necessarily as part of the coursework. Brief overview of each project is provided below. Details are available in respective folders.

### [Connect4](connect4)
A JavaScript implementation of the popular [Connect4 game](https://howdoyouplayit.com/connect-4-board-game-rules-play/), which allows for an arbitrary number of simultaneous two player games to be played over local network.

### [Cross-View Image Retrieval](cvir)
A Python implementation of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00725.pdf), which involves a novel cross-modal retrieval method specifically designed for multi-view (ground and aerial) images, leveraging a deep metric learning-based approach.

### [Expectation Maximization](em)
A Python implementation of the famous expectation maximization algorithm, along with number of clusters estimation.

### [Evolutionary Intelligence-Based Wall-Following Robots](wall-following-robots)
A Python implementation of wall-following robots, which are expected to become better at the task as they evolve, using genetic algorithms and finite state machine modeling.

### [Predicting Ultimate Outcome of the COVID-19 Outbreak](covid-19-puo)
A Python implementation (replication and extension) of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07912.pdf), which sought to predict eventual cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 as well as when will it come to an end in Italy, through logistic modeling of growth in cases. A framework is developed to extend the analysis to any country.

### [Sparse Representation-based Classifier](sparse-rep-classifier)
A MATLAB implementation of Sparse Representation-based Classifier (SRC), using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit to solve the P0 problem.

### [Talking Tom Trampoline](talking-tom-trampoline)
A C implementation of PIC microcontroller game with LED matrix, where an object (Tom) increases speed on each bounce off a moving board (trampoline).

### [Text Justification](justify)
A Haskell implementation of text justification, which is a common type of text alignment where spaces between words are stretched or compressed to align both ends of each line of text.

### [Tic-Tac-Toe](tic-tac-toe)
A C++ implementation of the popular Tic-Tac-Toe game, played against an unbeatable AI agent.
